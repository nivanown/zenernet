In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Zenernet retains the right to pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) If any part of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the balance of this Arbitration Provision will remain in full force and effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. <strong>You understand that, in the absence of this provision, you would have had a right to litigate disputes through a court, including the right to litigate claims on a class-wide or class-action basis, and that You have expressly and knowingly waived those rights and agreed to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</strong></p>
                            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                            <p>This website is intended to and directed to residents of the United States and all advertising claims contained in this website are valid only in the United States. This Agreement and the resolution of any dispute related to this Agreement or this website will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Kansas, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of this website or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. If any of these terms will be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term. You may have greater rights, or some of the provisions may be prohibited, by virtue of state or federal consumer protection laws. In such a case, to such extent, the subject provisions shall not apply to you.</p>
